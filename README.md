Palmprint_Recognition
=====================

A system that use palm print to authenticate an individual. This use Principle lines as features for detections purpose.

Human palm print is a wide spreading biometric trait that has been used to detect an individualâ€™s  identity  Palm  print  images  of  94  individuals  have  been  acquired  using 
Scanning techniques. Images acquired by this technique are used for the identification of an individual by extracting principle lines as a feature of palm print images using Matlab.
In this study an algorithm is proposed to compute and filter the first three principle lines of palm print images using Matlab that have been acquired using scanning technique. 
These  characteristic  features  are  used  to  estimate the  identity  of  an  individual.
Experiments show that the principle lines from the palm prints can be a good source for any biometric security system.
